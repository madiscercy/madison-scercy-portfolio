# Madison Scercy Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This project showcases my skills and projects as a software developer.

## Built With

This portfolio is built using the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A React framework with server-side rendering and path-based routing.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- [tsParticles](https://particles.matteobruni.it/): A lightweight TypeScript library for creating particles.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deployment

This portfolio is deployed using the Vercel Platform from the creators of Next.js. Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions that fits perfectly with your Next.js application.
